### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Dou Xiaobo, hearing impaired, graduated from Tianjin University of Technology on June 2008. <br>
Majored in Computer Science and Technology, I enjoy writing codes and command lines.<br>
After graduation, I worked in the printing room at a school until Junuary 2022, but I'd like to be able to grow and want more challenges.<br>
From February $10_{th}$ 2022 to Febrary $9_{th}$ 2024, I had joined Microsoft and worked as an Admin Assistant and Engineering Intern in Shanghai. During this period, I have focused on growing my technical skills development.<br>
I aspire to be **Software Engineer**. In the face of the difficulties on the road of learning and developing my coding skills, I never give up and always follow through with them. <br>

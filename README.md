### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Dou Xiaobo, hearing impaired, graduated from Computer Science and Technology at Tianjin University of Technology on June 2008. <br>
I love to enter codes and command lines.<br>
I was responsible for printing and copying at shool since August 2008 to January 2022, but the job does not match my specialty.<br>
Since February 2022, I am responsible for Admin Assistant at Microsoft Zizhu Campus in Shanghai, at the same time, focus on growing my technical skills development.<br>
I aspire to be **Software Engineer**. I never give up and follow through with it, when I get many difficult on the road of learning and growing my code skill.<br>

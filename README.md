### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I am Dou Xiaobo, a hearing-impaired individual who graduated from Tianjin University of Technology in June 2008. My major was Computer Science and Technology, and I have a profound passion for coding, command line and single-chip microcomputers.<br>

After graduation, I worked in the printing room at a school until January 2022, but I am eager to grow and embrace new challenges.<br>

From February 10th, 2022 to February 9th, 2024, I had the opportunity to join Microsoft and work as an Admin Assistant and Engineering Intern in Shanghai. During this period, I focused on growing my technical skills.<br>

I aspire to be a Software Engineer. Despite the difficulties I encounter on my journey to learning and enhancing my coding abilities, I never give up and always persist in my efforts.<br>

Currently, I am unemployed since February 10th of this year and am eagerly awaiting a new job opportunity. If you are willing to be my mentor and assist me in improving my coding skills, please do not hesitate to contact me. I would greatly appreciate your help.<br>
